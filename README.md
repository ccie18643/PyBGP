# PyBGP - Python BGP project

Basic BGP implementation in Python for educational purposes. At this time it fully supports Finite State Machine and its able to open and maintain connectivity to BGP peer in either passive or active mode. Connection collision detection is already implemented so its able to drop less desired connection if two of them form simultaneously. Project written in Python using Asyncio. Can support connectivity to multiple peers at the same time. Next to do is implementation of BGP updates.
